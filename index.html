				<p>Users of international legal services have often balked at the costs they incur for even the most routine of consultations or advice.</p>
				<p>Jomart & Co empathizes with the pricing dilemma that clients are faced with. On the one hand, large corporate firms have brand value but charge a hefty premium for their services – a premium that oft-times cannot be reasonably justified. On the other hand, relying on smaller boutique firms may cost less, but there is also a risk that they do not have the requisite expertise or client-oriented approach. Indeed, there are some law firms out there whose lawyers indulge in condemnable billing practices that breach their fiduciary duties towards the client, such as unjustified expense padding, overstating their hours worked or being deliberately opaque regarding their rates until the final bill is rendered.</p>
				<p>Costs of legal representation constitute the single largest share of expenses in international arbitration. Even if the disputing party finally wins the case, it may not be awarded the full costs of arbitration if the tribunal decides that its legal expenses were unreasonably high. Similarly, there are plenty of transactional firms that charge exorbitantly for negotiating and drafting even the simplest of international contracts. Regardless of how much money the client has on hand, excessive legal fees tend to take away resources that could otherwise be invested in core activities.</p>
				<p>Every client has a right to exceptional service and expertise without having to burn through its finances. Our firm guarantees that we have the client’s best interests at heart, regardless of whether those interests are legal or financial. This inclination guarantees that we deliver the highest quality service at very reasonable prices. We understand that each client highly values predictability, and we implement a fair, transparent pricing process with no hidden costs and all potential heads of expenditure comprehensively explained to the clients upfront. We rely on sophisticated technology and process management techniques to ensure that the work is done efficiently in a time-bound manner.</p>
				<p>Jomart & Co rejects adopting a rigid pricing policy. We believe in keeping all options open for our clients, whether those options include hourly fees, a contingency fee basis, capped-per-stage fees, a retainer basis or some hybrid fee structure. We are more than happy to discuss our billing policies with our clients to arrive at the most appropriate option depending on the clients’ interests and the suitability of the case at hand.</p>
